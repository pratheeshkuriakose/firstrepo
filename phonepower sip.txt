As mentioned, the KB article is being created, but here's our recommended settings for those interested:

[general]
;There will be other bits here but the following value should be changed
defaultexpirey=3600

; This will register your line to PhonePower and make it available via extensions.conf as [[SIP User ID]]
register => [[Auth ID]] [SIP Password]]@208.64.8.6:5060/[[SIP User ID]]

;This defines the peer.
; Notes are included to aid understanding
[phonepower-sip]
type=peer ;peer is used because it is a bi-directional channel
context=from-trunk ;context for calls originating here
insecure=very ;If this is not set inbound calls will not work
nat=never ;Our border elements will handle this. Configuring NAT traversal will break more than it fixes
dtmfmode=inband ;In our experience in-band DTMF with asterisk was much more reliable than RFC2833
username=[[SIP User ID]]
secret=[[SIP Password]]
authuser=[[Auth ID]]
host=208.64.8.6
fromuser=[[SIP User ID]]
fromdomain=208.64.8.6
maxexpirey=3600 ;
minexpirey=30 ;
disallow=all ;These 3 lines ensure all calls will only use G711 or G729
allow=uLaw ;
allow=g729 ;

It is strongly recommended that IP tables be configured as well to prevent unauthorized access.

The following is a rudimentary firewall config for an Asterisk server with a single network interface. As always this is for expert users only.

iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT –p tcp –dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/16 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT –s 172.16.0.0/12 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -s 208.64.8.6 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP

You will need to follow the directions for your Linux distribution to make this firewall persist on reboot.
For Redhat based distributions “/sbin/service iptables save” will save this config and “/sbin/chkconfig --level 345 iptables on”
 will ensure iptables starts with this config after each reboot. 









UPDATE:
Here is what is working for me. This has been stable for a week.
Outbound, both trunks are showing correctly when I specify the outbound route by dialing a prefix before the number.
Inbound, the calls to either trunk number show in FreePBX as inbound on the same trunk (trunk #1), but since the inbound route caller ID is specified, the calls are correctly routed to the ring groups I have specified for each trunk.
So it's a minor annoyance. The problem seems to be that both trunks are registering using the same port and IP address.
I have the maximum channels set to 2 on each trunk. I have verified that I can get 2 simultaneous calls on a single trunk, but I haven't determined if I can get all 4 going at once.

Solution would seem to be the ability to use a different IP and/or port on either my end or PP end, I have tried 5061, it won't register unless it's 12060 or 5060.
